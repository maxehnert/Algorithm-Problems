## Algorithm Problems

#### Checkout the JS folder for the problem sets

I get a weekly email from [Interview Cake](https://interviewcake.com) with algorithm problems. The problem I have with these is that they're almost always written in Python and I write Javascript. So although I'm not actively learning Python, I have been taking it upon myself to rewrite these problems in Javascript as best I can while learning some Python syntax.

Sometimes I just can't make it work. I don't understand what they're doing in Python or to do it in Javascript is just so much more complicated I can't hack it. Nevertheless I still try and when I do get one done I'll update this repo with my work.

Not all of the problems will come from that site because I want to do more than just 1 a week so I will pull from other places. I just enjoy getting them from there as they are more difficult and interesting than most algorithm problem sets and they're written in a language I don't know, so I have to work through the problem and by the end I have a really firm grasp of what is happening, rather than just copy/pasting problems.

I'm trying to learn ES6/ ECMAScript 2015 so I'll be trying to do as much as I can in that. Hopefully things get easier now that I'm using the updated ES6 syntax.

Some of these can be implemented into fun interfaces, so if I see a fit, I'll build out a quick click through for it like I did for my [Palindrome Checker](http://maxehnert.github.io/palindromes-on-palindromes/).
