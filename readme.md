## Algorithm Problems

#### Checkout the JS folder for the problem sets

This repo started as a way to work through fun interview style algorithm problems. It has since grown into a list of algorithms and tools I've written and keep up. Many of them have been useful for various tasks at work and in personal projects. Going back and looking at my own code and comments is often easier to parse than reading a stack overflow answer.

A lot of them can be completed with libraries like lodash, but I think it's important to understand the underlying code behind library implementations

The Design-Patterns folder is a list of design patterns I pulled from this book:

Authored by Addy Osmani
All credit goes to him for that work. I just wanted a central location of only code to review various design patterns.


Some of these can be implemented into fun interfaces, so if I see a fit, I'll build out a quick click through for it like I did for my [Palindrome Checker](http://maxehnert.github.io/palindromes-on-palindromes/).
